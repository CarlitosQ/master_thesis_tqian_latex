\Abstract

Integrated tunable lasers have been broadly used in DWDM coherent coommunication systems, where narrow linewidth is important in order to use high-order phase-sensitive modulation formats, and in access or passive optical networks (PON), where large direct modulation bandwidth and small chirp are crucial. 
% Narrow linewidth is important for continuous-wave (CW) lasers used in coherent optical communications as local oscillator or to feed I/Q modulators. In directly modulated lasers, modulation bandwidth and the chirp are the crucial quality factor.
% The optical feedback introduced improvement on directly modulated laser linewith, bandwidth and chirp has drawn a significant interest for the researchers.
% Laser with long external feedback section to achieve narrow linewith [] or coupling the laser with an ultra short section to generate the photon-photon resonance peak in the frequency response and extend bandwidth [] have beed reported.
% In this Master's theis work, the theretical modelling for the polymer-tunable DBR laser under feedback is presented.
In this Master's thesis, the effects of using feedback in order to reduce linewidth, increase modulation bandwidth and reduce chirp in DBR tunable lasers based on hybrid photonic integration on polymer are studied.
Measurements for such laser under feedback show different behavior in lasing spectrum and improvement in linewith, bandwidth and chirp. 
Additionally, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) where an on-chip feedback circuit has been implemented in order to control the optical-feedback effect and use it in a beneficial way, are presented.
% The studied model is then further used for the design of the on-chip controllable feedback.
Photon-photon resonance is first achieved in polymer-based tunable laser and opens the door for future enhancement of the modulation bandwidth using this effect.

% In practice external feedback when coupled into the laser cavity through the output facet, causes a modification of the photon density. This perturbation leads to a fluctuation in the carrier density affecting the optical gain. Since the fluctuations of optical refractive index are directly related to the carrier density [11], the external feedback also introduces phase fluctuations. The interaction of the intensity and phase fluctuations makes the dynamics of the laser system under self-injection very complex leading to system instabilities and even chaos.

% As high-speed fiber-optic communication becomes increasingly important, so does the need to perform precision measurements on lasers and lightwave systems.
