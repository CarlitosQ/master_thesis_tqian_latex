\Abstract

The optical feedback introduced improvement on laser linewith and bandwidth has drawn a significant interest for the researchers.

In practice external feedback when coupled into the laser cavity through the output facet, causes a modification of the photon density. This perturbation leads to a fluctuation in the carrier density affecting the optical gain. Since the fluctuations of optical refractive index are directly related to the carrier density [11], the external feedback also introduces phase fluctuations. The interaction of the intensity and phase fluctuations makes the dynamics of the laser system under self-injection very complex leading to system instabilities and even chaos. [Kechaou, Grillot et al 2012]

As high-speed fiber-optic communication becomes increasingly important, so does the need to perform precision measurements on lasers and lightwave systems.
